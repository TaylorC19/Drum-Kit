# Drum-Kit

## Purpose
  This project is a recreation of a drum kit app. The user can either push the buttons with the mouse or press the displayed key on the keyboard to play the respective sound.
  
## What I learned
  The focus on this project was Javascript. I learned commands without a library (such as JQuery). I learned how to use the DOM model to select elements, add listeners to keys and use functions within listeners, and add responsive commands to keypresses. Next, I learned how to add and remove CSS classes with javascript.
